# StartSAW
The project I made for the Web Applications Development internship at the University of Genoa.

This is a dynamic website, the assignment was to make a web application for a fake start-up. My group's idea was a start-up that develops music production softwares named "Harsh Noises".

The process behind the completion of the project was:

- Created a database based on an entity-relation system enabled by MySQL and administered via phpMyAdmin.
- The Database had the function of collecting all the users registered to our web app and all the products of a music production software developer start-up.
- Developed a Web Application using HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript that allowed the users to register and login, browse the startup’s products, search for one particular product, and contact the startup owners with an embedded mailer.
The Web App also allowed the admins to upload new products, ban users, and send a newsletter to all registered users implemented with phpMailer.
- Tested the web application locally using XAMPP’s Apache HTTP Server.
- Transferred the web application to the UniGe web server using FileZilla’s SFTP.
- Discussed the web application and its creation using a PowerPoint presentation.
